# Mastermind Board Game
Fun game to break the secret color code

How to Play?

At the beginning of each game a four color code will be generated.
The colors are always chosen from the seven colors in the top row. Duplicates are not allowed.
The objective is to guess the secret code. You have to guess the colors and put them in the same order as they are in the secret code.
Choose one color among the seven colors from the top row (blinking color is current color).
Place it in the circle of current row. After placing four colors, click on the Check button.
Whenever the check button is clicked Green/Red colors will be displayed in the small four circles which are after the Check button in the following way:
Green color:represents one of the colors what you have placed is there in the secret code and it is in correct position as in the secret code.
Red color:represents one of the colors what you have have placed is there in the secret code but it is not in correct position.
You have ten chances to guess the correct code, if you exhaust all of them without guessing the code, you lost the game and the secret code will be displayed in the last row.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
